# PridePack Versioning
The versioning shall consist of three elements:
- Pack Version `P.u.f`
- Update Version `p.U.f`
- Fix Version `p.u.F`

With `pack` corresponding to Minecraft's resource pack format, and the other ones following [`semver`](https://semver.org)

*The new versioning system will be applied on the \*would be\* 6.0 update.*
